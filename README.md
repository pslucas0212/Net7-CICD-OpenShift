# .Net 7 development CI/CD Pipeline to OpenShift

For this tutorial you will need an OpenShift cluster to deploy your .Net application.  I will use the test OCP cluster that I created in a previous tutorial, [OpenShift 4.12 vSphere Installer Provisioned Infrastructure Tutorial](https://github.com/pslucas0212/OCP4.12-IPI-vSphere-Install), to demonstrate .Net 7 development on a Mac

This tutorial [Run .Net 7 code on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on MacOS](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/run-.net-7-code-on-red-hat-openshift-container-platform-on-macos) how to setup a basic .Net 7 development environment on your Mac.

### Install the OpenShift Command Line Client
- To install the OCP CLI, we need to first login to the [OpenShift Container Platform downloads page]().
